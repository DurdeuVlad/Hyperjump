# Hyperjump

## Introduction

I made Hyperjump back in high school. It was my first big solo project, and the first time I really went all-in on building something end-to-end. I didn’t just mess around with ideas, I actually finished the damn thing. Designed it, built it in Unity, and even launched it on Google Play.

The game was simple on the surface, but that was the point. Tight gameplay loop, clean visuals, fast sessions. And yeah, jumping over asteroids turned out to be more fun than I expected.

Sadly, the Google Play listing is gone because my account got deactivated for inactivity (lesson learned), but this project still means a lot to me.

## Gameplay Overview

The core loop is all about timing: you jump from platform to platform, dodging or leaping over moving asteroids that fly in your path. Miss a jump or hit an asteroid? Game over.

Built to be fast, addictive, and minimal.

- Tap-to-jump controls
- Randomized asteroid patterns to keep it interesting
- Increasing difficulty over time
- Clean, arcade-style visuals

## Development Notes

- Engine: Unity
- Language: C#
- Target Platform: Android (originally published on Google Play)

This was where I learned the Unity pipeline, scene setup, rigidbodies, collision detection, UI, audio, the whole deal. I kept everything lightweight to maintain solid framerates on low-end Android phones.

## Lessons Learned

- Publishing a game is a lot more work than just coding it
- Polish matters, a small game can still feel premium if it’s clean
- Playtesting is everything (turns out people *love* dodging stuff)
- If you're not maintaining your Google developer account, they'll nuke it

## Final Thoughts

Hyperjump was the start of it all for me. I still look back at it and see the moment things clicked. That I could build, launch, and share a game on my own. It wasn’t perfect, but it was mine.
